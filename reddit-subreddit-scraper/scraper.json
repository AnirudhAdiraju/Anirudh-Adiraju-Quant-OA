As an investor, those businesses look the *same* under EBITDA, but one is clearly not as good. Buffet  knows that companies always try and put their best foot forward, so the worse company will prominently lean on their \u201cexcellent\u201d EBITDA when that is just obscuring a weakness with their business.\n\nSo why is EBITDA even a thing at all then? It can be useful to see discrepancies, like \u201cthis company would be much better *if not for this one aspect*\u201d when maybe that aspect can be changed. A company doing a takeover might look at EBITDA and expect to neutralize the debt or restructure capital investments, or expect to leverage their international tax structures to reduce those burdens that weigh down the earnings of a company.\n\nBuffet is railing against using it as a *common* metric when it is only useful in specific niche situations. Especially when it is so appealing to general companies with poor business structures trying to disguise their biggest weaknesses."

For example, Debt/EBITDA aka leverage is used to evaluate how much debt a company has relative to earnings, and to inform capital structure decisions (and for lenders, the basis for how much debt that company can support. For that metric to make sense/not be iterative, you have to look at the denominator before the impact of interest (and tax shield impact). EBITDA is also the basis for many valuation methodologies for the same reason, to determine how much overall capital a company can support (debt and equity) relative to earnings.\n\nBuffet\u2019s stance is that interest, taxes and depreciation are important indicators of company decision making and industry dynamics. Which is true, you should look at a wide range of metrics (EBITDA, Net Income, Free Cash Flow, etc.) when evaluating companies to see the wholistic picture"

Russia tried to make the payment on April 4th, but it was blocked under US Sanctions. The Treasury Department had recently granted a waiver in March on such payments, but it's recent denial show an expanded effort to cut Russia off from global borrowing markets. \n\nRussia is in a classification of \"selective default\", in which it only failed to make payments on it's foreign currency debt. It still has a 30 day grace period from the missed payment on April 4th to make investors whole, but S&P believes further sanctions are coming and Russia will not have the ability to honor it's obligations. It's local currency debt is still rated in the category just above \"default\". \n\nInterestingly, S&P stated last month that it would halt ratings on Russian debt. They will no longer issue ratings on Russian debt after April 15th. They had to throw the default grenade into the mix just before they left the room.",

Potential targets use this tactic in order to make them look less attractive to the potential acquirer: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/poisonpill.asp\n\n**Article:**\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/15/twitter-board-adopts-poison-pill-after-musks-43-billion-offer-to-buy-company.html\n\nTwitter adopted a limited duration shareholder rights plan, often called a \u201cpoison pill,\u201d a day after billionaire Elon Musk offered to buy the company for $43 billion, the company announced Friday.\n\nThe board voted unanimously to adopt the plan.\n\nUnder the new structure, if any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of at least 15% of Twitter\u2019s outstanding common stock without the board\u2019s approval, other shareholders will be allowed to purchase additional shares at a discount.\n\nThe plan is set to expire on April 14, 2023.\n\nSuch a move is a common way to fend off a potential hostile takeover by diluting the stake of the entity eying the takeover.\n\n\u201cThe Rights Plan will reduce the likelihood that any entity, person or group gains control of Twitter through open market accumulation without paying all shareholders an appropriate control premium or without providing the Board sufficient time to make informed judgments and take actions that are in the best interests of shareholders,\u201d the company said in a press release.\n\nTwitter noted that the rights plan would not prevent the board from accepting an acquisition offer if the board deems it in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.\n\nMusk already owns a more than 9% stake in Twitter as revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week. Soon after his stake became public, Twitter\u2019s CEO announced plans for Musk to join the board. But days later, Musk reversed course and decided not to join the board after all.\n\nIf he had joined, Musk would not be allowed to accumulate more than 14.9% of beneficial ownership of the company\u2019s outstanding common stock.\n\nAlso on Friday, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources, that Twitter brought on JPMorgan to help respond to Musk\u2019s bid. Twitter had already been working with Goldman Sachs and Musk has been working with Morgan Stanley.\n\nSeveral outlets including The New York Post reported Twitter was also fielding interest from Thoma Bravo, though it\u2019s still uncertain a bid will materialize, according to sources who spoke to Reuters.\n\nJPMorgan has history with Musk, suing Tesla over a matter related to his 2018 tweet claiming he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take the company private. Tesla later countersued the bank.\n\nJPMorgan, Twitter and Thoma Bravo declined comment.\n\nIn a live-streamed interview at the TED2022 conference in Vancouver on Thursday, Musk laid out his vision for making Twitter\u2019s algorithms more publicly accessible and limiting content moderation.\n\nHe also acknowledged he\u2019s \u201cnot sure\u201d if he\u2019ll actually be able to buy Twitter, though he said he does have \u201csufficient assets\u201d to fund the deal if accepted. Despite his fortune, Musk has much of his assets tied up in equity in his companies including Tesla, meaning he\u2019d likely have to liquidate or borrow against his assets to come up with a large sum.\n\nBut Musk said \u201cthere is\u201d a Plan B if his initial offer to buy the company and take it private, which he called his \u201cbest and final,\u201d is rejected. He declined to provide further details in the TED interview.\n\nOn Friday, Twitter\u2019s former CEO and current board member Jack Dorsey tweeted that \u201cthe real issue\u201d is that \u201cas a public company, twitter has always been \u2018for sale.\u2019\u201d",

Of the companies that have reported so far, about 80% have beat analyst expectations, according to FactSet, which has helped provide some stability to the U.S. stock market.\n\n\u201cUsually when the economy\u2019s slowing down, or there is a perception it\u2019ll slow down, there are obvious sectors to hide in. Those traditional sectors aren\u2019t as safe from an earnings basis as they are historically because they still are going to have negative impacts from inflation,\u201d said Tavis McCourt, institutional equity strategist at Raymond James.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its worst one-day percentage change since October 2020, losing 981.36 points, or 2.8%, to close at 33811.40. The S&P 500 dropped 121.88 points, or 2.8%, to 4271.78, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 335.36 points, or 2.5%, to finish at 12839.29. \n\nThe recent rise in government-bond yields showed signs of steadying, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ending Friday at 2.905%, down two of the past three trading days. Yields staged a climb earlier Friday before reversing course. Bond yields rise when prices decline.\n\nHealthcare stocks are often considered defensive, with money managers betting that consumers will pay medical bills before making discretionary purchases. The S&P 500\u2019s healthcare sector fell 3.6%, its worst day since June 2020.\n\nConcerns about inflation and the pace of monetary tightening by the Fed also remained at the forefront of investors\u2019 minds this week. On Thursday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave investors a clear signal that the central bank is ready to tighten monetary policy more quickly and indicated that it was likely to raise interest rates by a half-percentage point at its meeting in May.\n\nA rate increase next month, following the Fed\u2019s quarter percentage point increase in March, would mark the first time since 2006 that the central bank increased its policy rate at back-to-back meetings.\n\nMr. Powell\u2019s comments injected fresh volatility into a stock market that has been whipsawed this year by the war in Ukraine, soaring inflation and rising Covid-19 cases in China.\n\n\u201cThe market is finally internalizing and factoring in the reality that the Fed really means what it says and it\u2019s not going to back down,\u201d said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer of Exencial Wealth Advisors. \u201cSomebody had a saying, and it\u2019s pretty\n good: \u2018You don\u2019t fight the Fed when the Fed is fighting inflation.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn commodities, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil, fell $1.68 a barrel, or 1.6%, to $106.65. It fell 4.5% this week.\n\n---\n\nJust want to add, there's been some negative correlation between oil and the rest of the market, but today everything was bloody red.",

While this decision was necessary, it was not one we undertook lightly, and I\u2019d like to share our rationale.\u00a0\n\nAs you know, throughout 2020 and H1 2021, we went through a period of hyper growth accelerated by several factors including pandemic lockdowns, low interest rates, and fiscal stimulus. We grew net funded accounts from 5M to 22M and revenue from \\~$278M in 2019 to over $1.8B in 2021. To meet customer and market demands, we grew our headcount almost 6X from 700 to nearly 3800 in that time period.\n\nThis rapid headcount growth has led to some duplicate roles and job functions, and more layers and complexity than are optimal. After carefully considering all these factors, we determined that making these reductions to Robinhood\u2019s staff is the right decision to improve efficiency, increase our velocity, and ensure that we are responsive to the changing needs of our customers.",

He added that he blamed the financial industry for motivating risky behavior among investors. While he finds speculative bets \u201cobscene,\u201d the pickup in volatility across the markets has had one good effect, he said: It has allowed Berkshire to find undervalued businesses to invest in again following a period of relative quiet. \n\nUp until recently, Berkshire had largely been sitting on its cash pile. Its business thrived; a recovering economy and roaring stock market helped push net earnings to a record in 2021. But it didn\u2019t announce any major deals, something that led many analysts and investors to wonder about its next moves. Berkshire ended the year with a near record amount of cash on hand. (After Berkshire\u2019s buying spree, the size of the company\u2019s war chest shrank to $106.26 billion at the end of the first quarter, from $146.72 billion three months earlier.)\n\nMr. Buffett\u2019s feeling that there were no appealing investment opportunities for Berkshire quickly gave way to excitement in late February, he said Saturday, when he got a copy of Alleghany Chief Executive Joseph Brandon\u2019s annual report.\n\nBerkshire\u2019s decision to build up a 14% stake in Occidental also came about with a report. Mr. Buffett said he had read an analyst note on the company, whose stock is still trading below its 2011 high, and decided the casino-like market conditions made it a good time to buy the stock.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we ever had anything quite like we have now in terms of the volumes of pure gambling activity going on daily,\u201d Mr. Munger said. \u201cIt\u2019s not pretty.\u201d \n\nBut the amount of speculation in the markets has given Berkshire a chance to spot undervalued businesses, Mr. Munger said, allowing the company to put its $106 billion cash reserve to work.\n\nNeither Mr. Buffett nor Mr. Munger specifically addressed Berkshire\u2019s decision to increase its Chevron stake.\n\nBut the two men offered a defense of the oil industry. It is a good thing for the U.S. to be producing more of its own oil, Mr. Buffett said. Mr. Munger went further, saying he could hardly think of a more useful industry. \n\n---\n\nPersonally I'm not sure what made OXY or CVX so much more appealing this year than last year or the year before, when they were selling for much less.",

                "text": "Link to article from [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/6/23059930/nvidia-sec-charges-fine-settlement-gaming-gpu-crypto-mining)\n\n\"Nvidia will pay $5.5 million to settle charges that it unlawfully obscured how many of its graphics cards were sold to cryptocurrency miners. The US Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges and a settlement with the company today. Its order claims Nvidia misled investors by reporting a huge boost in revenue related to \u201cgaming,\u201d hiding how much its success relied on the far more volatile crypto market. Nvidia isn\u2019t admitting to wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but it agrees to stop any unlawful failures to disclose information.\n\nThe charges stem from Nvidia\u2019s fiscal year 2018 financial reports. The SEC notes Nvidia saw an explosion in crypto mining-related sales in 2017, when the rewards of mining Ethereum grew dramatically. Crypto mining was widely reported as a cause of GPU scarcity, and Nvidia launched a separate CMP line specifically for mining, attempting to prevent shortages for gamers. But employees apparently acknowledged that many gaming GPUs were still going to miners. \u201cThe company\u2019s sales personnel, in particular in China, reported what they believed to be significant increases in demand for Gaming GPUs as a result of crypto mining,\u201d the order says.\n\nGiven the boom-and-bust nature of cryptocurrency, this meant Nvidia\u2019s sales numbers didn\u2019t necessarily indicate reliable future growth, making investing in it riskier. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s analysts and investors were interested in understanding the extent to which the company\u2019s Gaming revenue was impacted by crypto mining and routinely asked senior management about the extent to which increases in gaming revenue during this time frame were driven by crypto mining,\u201d the SEC alleges.\n\nDespite this, Nvidia didn\u2019t mention mining-related sales as a factor in its gaming division\u2019s success. Meanwhile, it mentioned crypto as an important factor in other markets, which suggested to the SEC that it was being deliberately deceptive. And investors\u2019 anxieties turned out to be well-founded. A crypto crash in late 2018 (along with a weakening Chinese market) led it to slash its quarterly earnings projections by $500 million and spurred a shareholder lawsuit.\n\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s disclosure failures deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company\u2019s business in a key market,\u201d says SEC Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit head Kristina Littman. \u201cAll issuers, including those that pursue opportunities involving emerging technology, must ensure that their disclosures are timely, complete, and accurate.\u201d\"\n\n[Edit] lots of people asking why this is illegal.\n\nAccording to the investigation, Nvidia conducted internal research which indicated this was how the cards were being used. Instead of notifying shareholders about this, they claimed to be increasing their market share in the gaming sphere. Of course, this becomes problematic for investors when crypto goes into a bear market (like now), and investors are left holding bags wondering why everyone is buying second hand cards from miners all of a sudden.",

                        "text": "Matt Levine @ Bloomberg starts off his long comment on this with the following:\n\n\n\u201cTemporarily on hold\u201d is not a thing. Elon Musk has signed a binding contract requiring him to buy Twitter. Legions of bankers and lawyers and Twitter employees and special-purpose-vehicle promoters are working to fulfill his legal obligation to get the deal closed. \u201cThe parties hereto will use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,\u201d says the merger agreement. (Section 6.3(a).) He can\u2019t just put that \u201con hold.\u201d\n\n\nThat contract does not allow Musk to walk away if it turns out that \u201cspam/fake accounts\u201d represent more than 5% of Twitter users. We discussed this last month, when Twitter admitted in a securities filing that it had (slightly) overestimated its daily active users for years. The merger agreement contains a provision that allows Musk to walk away if Twitter\u2019s securities filings are wrong \u2014 and this 5% number is in its securities filings \u2014 but only if the inaccuracy would have a \u201cMaterial Adverse Effect\u201d on the company. (See Sections 4.6(a) and 7.2(b).) That is an incredibly high standard: Delaware courts have almost never found an MAE. An MAE has to be something that would \u201csubstantially threaten the overall earnings potential of the target in a durationally-significant manner,\u201d the courts have said; there is a rule of thumb that an MAE requires a 40% decrease in long-term profitability. If it turned out that 6% or 20% or 50% of Twitter accounts are bots, that will be embarrassing and might even reduce Twitter\u2019s future advertising revenue, but will it be an MAE? No.\n\n\u201cPending details supporting calculation\u201d is not how this works. This disclosure \u2014 that \u201cthe average of false or spam accounts ... represented fewer than 5% of\u201d Twitter\u2019s monetizable daily active users \u2014 has been in Twitter\u2019s securities filings for many years, always with a caveat that \u201cin making this determination, we applied significant judgment, so our estimation of false or spam accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts, and the actual number of false or spam accounts could be higher than we have estimated.\u201d Musk had the opportunity to read these filings before offering to buy Twitter, and he had the opportunity to do due diligence on these numbers before signing the deal. (He declined.) He can\u2019t now go to Twitter and say \u201cactually now you need to prove that your user numbers are right.\u201d If he wants to walk, he has to prove that they\u2019re wrong, and also that they\u2019re wrong in a way that has a material adverse effect on the business. Which he obviously can\u2019t do."

I am not suggesting that it would actually have been wiser to blow money on luxuries than to invest.  And I am fully aware of what it means for a loss to be unrealized.  But the following is mathematically true:  If I liquidated my portfolio in November, spent $35K on luxuries between that day and the day of my post, and then on the day of my post I bought back into the market with my remaining cash, I would have the exact same assets and net worth as I did in reality.  That is a fact.  And it's a fact that I found sad, because *with the benefit of hindsight, knowing exactly what the market would do*, it would in fact have been better to spend the $35K on luxuries.  But in reality, we never know exactly when the market will tank, so, in reality, it would not make sense to choose luxuries over investing.  Nothing in my post is meant to suggest investing is a bad idea; you can't time the market and you have to accept that the value of your assets will drop sometimes.",

If everyone is suddenly 40% poorer, the number of buyers will be drying up at the same time. This would cause prices to fall.\n\nThis is obviously hypothetical and we're not there...yet.

                "text": "[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/10/consumer-price-index-may-2022.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/10/consumer-price-index-may-2022.html)\n\n \n\nInflation accelerated further in May, with prices rising 8.6% from a  year ago for the fastest increase since December 1981, the Bureau of  Labor Statistics reported Friday.\n\nThe consumer price index, a  wide-ranging measure of goods and services prices, increased even more  than the 8.3% Dow Jones estimate. Excluding volatile food and energy  prices, so-called core CPI was up 6%, slightly higher than the 5.9%  estimate.\n\nOn a monthly basis, headline CPI was up 1% while core rose 0.6%, compared to respective estimates of 0.7% and 0.5%.\n\nSurging shelter, gasoline and food prices all contributed to the increase.\n\nEnergy  prices broadly rose 3.9% from a month ago, bringing the annual gain to  34.6%. Within the category, fuel oil posted a 16.9% monthly gain,  pushing the 12-month surge to 106.7%.\n\nShelter costs, which account  for about a one-third weighting on the CPI, rose 0.6% for the month,  the fastest one-month gain since March 2004. The 5.5% 12-month gain is  the most since February 1991.\n\nFinally, food costs climbed another 1.2% in May, bringing the year-over-year gain to 10.1%.\n\nThose  escalating prices meant workers took another pay cut during the month.  Real wages when accounting for inflation fell 0.6% in April, even though  average hourly earnings rose 0.3%. On a 12-month basis, real average  hourly earnings were down 3%.\n\nMarkets reacted negatively to the  report, with stock futures indicating a sharply lower open on Wall  Street and government bond yields rising.\n\nSome of the biggest increases came in airfares (up 12.6% on the month), used cars and trucks (1.8%), and dairy products (2.9%).\n\nFriday\u2019s numbers dented hopes that inflation may have peaked and adds to fears that the U.S. economy is nearing a recession.\n\nThe  inflation report comes with the Federal Reserve in the early stages of a  rate-hiking campaign to slow growth and bring down prices. May\u2019s report  likely solidifies the likelihood of multiple 50 basis point interest  rate increases ahead.\n\n\u201cObviously, nothing is good in this report,\u201d  said Julian Bridgen, president of MI2 Partners, a global macroeconomic  research firm. \u201cThere is nothing in there that\u2019s going to give the Fed  any cheer. ... I struggle to see how the Fed can back off.\u201d\n\nWith  75 basis points of interest rate rises already under its belt, markets  widely expect the Fed to continue tightening policy through the year and  possibly into 2023. The central bank\u2019s benchmark short-term borrowing  rate is currently anchored around 0.75% -1% and is expected to rise to  2.75%-3% by the end of the year, according to CME Group estimates.\n\nInflation has been a political headache for the White House and President [Joe Biden](https://www.cnbc.com/joe-biden/).\n\nAdministration officials pin most of the blame for the surge on supply chain issues related to [the Covid pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/), imbalances created by outsized demand for goods over services, and [the Russian attack on Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/10/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html).\n\nIn  a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, Biden said he will push for further  improvements to supply chains and continue efforts to bring down the  budget deficit.\n\nHowever, he and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen  both have emphasized that much of the responsibility for lowering  inflation belongs to the Fed. The administration has largely denied that  the trillions of dollars directed toward Covid aid played a major role.\n\nHow  much the central bank will have to raise rates remains to be seen.  Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers recently released a white paper  with a team of other economists that suggests the Fed will need to go  further than many are anticipating. The paper asserts that the current  inflation predicament is closer to the 1980s situation than it appears  because of differences in the ways that CPI is computed then and now.",

My contention is that this time is truly different.  Hear me out.\n\nDuring 2001-2003, while the overall equity markets were down each of the three years, there was still money to be made in commodities, fixed income, and precious metals.\n\nIn 2008, which is the worst market of all our lifetimes, one could make money in alternatives, fixed income (especially taxable income), and healthcare.\n\nEven in 1973-74, there was money to be made in T-Bills, T-Bonds, and real estate.\n\nThis year has been different. There is money to be made in commodities especially with energy.  The only other sector that has been profitable is agriculture.  What seems to make this different, is that the more traditional hedges against down markets such as fixed income and precious metals have been losers too. The last time we had a market that was down over -20% and the treasury bond index was negative was in 1931. It appears we are in new territory for many of us, including professionals. This is function of rising interest rates from historical lows and an uncertain future for the global economy.  Based on inflationary numbers, every country on this planet is feeling it.  \n\nHang in there folks. I won't say prepare for impact, but do prepare for a continued bumpy ride.",

That is forecast to drop to a mere 11 percent over the next four years, says John Murphy, the Bank of America analyst behind the annual Car Wars report that looks at the auto industry and predicts which companies are on a winning path and which are not.\n\n>Musk's apparent idea that the supposedly unsophisticated auto industry didn't know how to manufacture came back to bite him when he learned firsthand how hard it is to make cars, learned that those legacy techniques work, and was forced to adopt them. \"That was a big miss on his part,\" Murphy says.\n\nI have said before that I won't touch Tesla stock either way, because underestimating has proven a mistake, even in the face of obvious headwinds... but other manufacturers are releasing _135 EV models_ over the coming years, so something is going to stick. We've already seen demand exceeding supply for the F150 and Mach E.\n\n>\"He is launching new product at a slower rate, he does not have a full product portfolio, so there is a huge opportunity for other competitors to shoot the gap and catch up,\"\n\nTesla does not have a real SUV, they have hatchbacks. There is a huge market miss there. They don't have a truck, and that is a _huge_ moneymaker for auto manufacturers. They don't have anything compact or \"cheap.\"\n\nIt's important to note after all of this that the share of cars being EV is increasing, so even with falling market share expect their production to increase. But I don't think it's going to be 90% of the market as some Tesla bulls predict.\n\nTesla's EV market share in Europe declined from 31% in 2019 to 13% in 2020. Last month it was 10% market share. A declining share can happen.",

I can go on...\n\nI am still scratching my head why we still have this issue long after government handouts ended.\n\nI know many have retired and most of them will probably never return to the workforce. But I suspect they make up a relatively small portion of the supply shortage of workers. I have questions about the rest. Are they living on sustenance level somewhere and gave up on the rat's race? Where are the able-bodied workers who for whatever reason are not working and why are they not working? Why is my local McDonalds still so understaffed? ",

Singapore-based 3AC is one of the higher profile crypto investors to have run into difficulties following the sharp sell-off in the market for digital currencies seen in recent months. Crypto broker Voyager Digital issued 3AC with a default notice on Monday after it failed to make payments on a loan of 15,250 bitcoin (approximately $324 million) and $350 million worth of USDC, a stablecoin",

After investing heavily in personnel, technology, inventory and supply chain infrastructure over the past 18 months, our focus is on achieving sustained profitability. This means eliminating excess costs and operating with an intense owner\u2019s mentality. Everyone in the organization must become even more hands-on and embrace a heightened level of accountability for results.\n\nWith that said, I\u2019m getting in touch today to share three organizational updates:\n\n1.  After making more than 600 corporate hires in 2021 and the first half of 2022, we have a stronger understanding of our transformation needs. This has positioned us to right-size headcount across several corporate departments. Today, we\u2019re making a number of reductions to help us keep things simple and operate nimbly with the right talent in place.\n\n2. We\u2019re going to be making a significant investment in our Store Leaders and field employees, who play a critical role fulfilling the needs of our customers. These individuals are, in many respects, the heart of GameStop. We\u2019ll be sharing details regarding this investment in the coming weeks.\n\n3. Mike Recupero, who has served as our Chief Financial Officer since last June, is departing. Diana Jajeh, who has been our Chief Accounting Officer and possesses strong institutional knowledge of the business, has been appointed Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThese changes will enable us to operate in a profitable manner as we execute against our strategy of pursuing sales growth in our commerce business and launching new products that empower customers within the digital asset and web3 gaming verticals. I\u2019m confident in the team we have in place going forward, and thank you again for your continued dedication and focus.\n\nRegards,\nMatt \""

Meta\u2019s Novi pilot\u2014a money-transfer service using the company\u2019s own cryptocurrency digital wallet\u2014will end on Sept. 1, the service said on its website, a link to which it texted to its users. Both the Novi app and Novi on WhatsApp will no longer be available, the company said on the Website. Starting July 21, users will no longer be able to add money to their accounts, Novi said, advising users to withdraw their balance \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d Users won\u2019t be able to access their transaction history or other data after the pilot ends. The company does plan to use Novi\u2019s technology in future products, such as in its metaverse project, a company spokesperson said in an email. \u201cWe are already leveraging the years spent on building capabilities for Meta overall on blockchain and introducing new products, such as digital collectibles,\u201d Meta said in the statement. \u201cYou can expect to see more from us in the web3 space because we are very optimistic about the value these technologies can bring to people and businesses in the metaverse.\u201d\n\nThe stock has been cut by more than half in 2022. Although Wall Street has been in a buying mood last week, real world pressures continue to make META stock one to avoid. Alternatively, if investors can\u2019t help but like META stock at current prices, I\u2019d similarly point to a long vertical spread using call contracts or a fully hedged collar for those interested in owning shares. But again, the belief is those efforts will be in vain and only serve the purpose of vastly reducing downside risk.\n\nMeta Platforms has many issues to contend with. For example, Facebook Reels\u2019 inability to challenge top rival TikTok, Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in long form video, competition in ecommerce from Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), falling consumer brand value and Meta\u2019s risky metaverse pivot, which might overlook its existing platforms.\n\n&#x200B;",

                "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Twitter Inc. wants a lightning-quick trial to resolve its claim that billionaire Elon Musk wrongfully canceled his proposed $44 billion buyout of the social-media platform.\n\nLawyers for the San Francisco-based company say they need only four days in Delaware Chancery Court to prove that the world\u2019s richest man should be forced to honor his agreement and pay $54.20 a share for Twitter. The company hopes to start the non-jury case on Sept. 19. Legal experts, however, predict the case will take about two weeks to try.\n\nUnlike some states where it can take several years to get a case to trial, Delaware Chancery Court generally moves quicker. Chancery judges -- business law experts -- are known for being able to parse through the legal thickets of complex merger and acquisition disputes more quickly and thoroughly than other US courts. Even complex business cases are often argued before a judge within six or seven months of being filed.\n\nThe Twitter buyout agreement specifies all legal disputes over the deal must be heard in Delaware, corporate home to more than half of U.S. public companies, including Twitter and Musk\u2019s Tesla Inc..\n\nMusk and his lawyers didn\u2019t immediately return emails Tuesday seeking comment on both the suit and whether the case can be tried on Twitter\u2019s schedule. Musk did issue a tweet Tuesday, saying: \u201cOh the irony lol.\u201d\n\nA judge hasn\u2019t yet been assigned to the case, but Chief Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick already has taken on investor suits over the teetering transaction. She may pick up Twitter\u2019s suit as well. McCormick, a Delaware native, is a former legal-aid lawyer and graduate of Notre Dame Law School.\n\nTwitter\u2019s legal team argues it can easily show in less than a week of court time that Musk didn\u2019t have legitimate grounds to nix the $54.20-per-share buyout. Twitter shares rose 8.1% to $36.83 at 3:01 p.m. Wednesday.\n\n\u201cLitigation on the schedule Twitter proposes permits the parties and their experienced counsel ample time to assemble a trial record,\u201d the lawyers wrote.\n\nThat would provide enough time for a judge to rule and have the Delaware Supreme Court review the ruling before the Oct. 24 closing date for the transaction, the lawyers said.\n\nCharles Elson, a retired University of Delaware finance professor and former head of the school\u2019s Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, says don\u2019t bet on it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say a four-day trial is way more than optimistic,\u201d Elson said Wednesday in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of water under the bridge on this deal and I\u2019d say it going to take more like 10 days to try it.\u201d\n\nLast year, Musk traveled to Delaware for over challenge from Tesla investors to his more than $2 billion purchase of renewable-power provider SolarCity, a company he founded with his cousins. That case ate up 10 trial days. A judge ultimately concluded Musk didn\u2019t force an overpriced SolarCity acquisition down the throats of his fellow Tesla directors.\n\nVia: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/twitter-lawyers-prevail-over-musk-002444854.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/twitter-lawyers-prevail-over-musk-002444854.html)",

Buyers have been contending with high prices all year, but with rates almost double what they were in January, they\u2019ve lost considerable purchasing power.\n\n\u201cPurchase activity declined for both conventional and government loans as the weakening economic outlook, high inflation and persistent affordability challenges are impacting buyer demand,\u201d said Joel Kan, an economist for the MBA.\n\nWhile buyers are less affected by weekly moves in interest rates, the broader picture of rising rates has already taken its toll. Mortgage rates moved higher again last week after falling slightly over the past three weeks.\n\nThe average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($647,200 or less) increased to 5.82% from 5.74%, with points increasing to 0.65 from 0.59 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. That rate was 3.11% the same week one year ago.\n\nDemand for refinances, which are highly rate sensitive, fell 4% for the week and were 80% lower than the same week last year. Those applications are also at a 22-year low, but the drop in demand from homebuyers caused the refinance share of mortgage activity to increase to 31.4% of total applications from 30.8% the previous week.\n\nMortgage interest rates haven\u2019t moved much this week, but that could change very soon due to increasing bond market volatility. The Federal Reserve is expected to hike rates by another 75 basis points next week, and other central banks are taking similar action against inflation. A basis point equals 0.01%.\n\n\u201cThis is especially true next week as markets digest the newest Fed policy announcement next Wednesday, but Thursday\u2019s policy announcement from the European Central Bank could also cause enough of a stir to impact U.S. rates,\u201d noted Matthew Graham, chief operating officer of Mortgage News Daily.\n\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/20/mortgage-demand-drops-to-lowest-level-in-22-years.html",

                "text": "Related post on reddit: [**Twitter Says It Can Beat Musk\u2019s Claims in Four Trial Days**](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/vyt06k/twitter_says_it_can_beat_musks_claims_in_four/)\n\n(Financial Times) -- Elon Musk says he needs more time to prepare for courtroom showdown over his attempt to back out of $44bn deal\n\nElon Musk has accused Twitter of an \u201cunjustifiable request to rush\u201d the trial to determine whether he should be forced to complete a $44bn deal to buy the social media company.\n\nMusk has suggested a trial start in February at the earliest, according to a court filing from his lawyers on Friday. That is several months later than the September timing being pushed for by Twitter in its lawsuit, which was filed in Delaware chancery court just days after Musk announced his intention to terminate the deal.\n\nLawyers representing the Tesla chief executive on Friday said in the 16-page response to Twitter\u2019s lawsuit that the question of spam accounts on the network \u2014 one of the primary reasons Musk has given for attempting to back out of the deal \u2014 was \u201cfundamental\u201d to the case and required lengthier investigation and \u201csubstantial time for discovery\u201d.\n\nMusk\u2019s lawyers described the proposed trial date, and the suggestion by Twitter it could be completed in four days, as being on a \u201cbreakneck schedule\u201d.\n\n\u201cTwitter\u2019s sudden request for warp speed after two months of foot-dragging and obfuscation is its latest tactic to shroud the truth about spam accounts long enough to railroad defendants into closing,\u201d the filing read.\n\nA hearing on the matter is due to be held on Tuesday. Twitter declined to comment.\n\nThe social media company\u2019s lawsuit accused Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, of trying to back out of the deal on account of the rout in tech stocks that has hurt the value of Twitter and many of its peers. On July 8, when Musk announced his intention to back out of the deal worth $54.20 per share, the stock had fallen to $36.81.\n\nIn a case that has captivated the corporate world, Musk\u2019s defence rests on his ability to convince the court that the issue of bots \u2014 automated spam accounts \u2014 on the platform is far greater than previously disclosed, representing a \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d that would give him the ability to back out of the deal.\n\nMusk has alleged Twitter had breached the merger agreement by not sharing sufficient information on fake accounts, a position reiterated in Friday\u2019s filing, which again questioned the company\u2019s long-stated estimate that bots made up less than 5 per cent of users.\n\nFollowing a meeting between Musk and Twitter\u2019s chief executive Parag Agrawal, \u201cMusk was stunned to discover that Twitter\u2019s process for identifying spam accounts relied on human reviewers to eyeball a minuscule portion of the userbase rather than utilising the company\u2019s machine learning capabilities\u201d, the filing said.\n\nIn its lawsuit, Twitter argued Musk had been well aware of the site\u2019s issue with bots, pointing to tweets posted by Musk highlighting the matter prior to the deal.\n\nThe social network also accused Musk of breaching the terms of the merger agreement that demanded he not disparage the company, by highlighting his tweets that appeared to be goading Twitter\u2019s leadership.\n\nAddressing that claim, Musk\u2019s filing accused Twitter of being unable to take a joke.\n\n\u201cWith the sense of humor of a bot, Twitter claims that Musk is damaging the company with tweets like a Chuck Norris meme and a poop emoji,\u201d the filing stated. \u201cTwitter ignores that Musk is its second-largest shareholder with a far greater economic stake than the entire Twitter board.\u201d\n\nVia: [https://www.ft.com/content/50691d5a-f454-4d96-803a-ac31bdf22805](https://www.ft.com/content/50691d5a-f454-4d96-803a-ac31bdf22805) (non-paywall: [https://archive.ph/YCCmP](https://archive.ph/YCCmP))",

How does that relate to the NBER's recession dates?\n\nA: Most of the recessions identified by our procedures do consist of two or more consecutive quarters of declining real GDP, but not all of them. In 2001, for example, the recession did not include two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP. In the recession from the peak in December 2007 to the trough in June 2009, real GDP declined in the first, third, and fourth quarters of 2008 and in the first and second quarters of 2009. Real GDI declined for the final three quarters of 2001 and for five of the six quarters in the 2007\u20132009 recession.\n\nQ: Why doesn't the committee accept the two-quarter definition?\n\nA: There are several reasons. First, we do not identify economic activity solely with real GDP, but consider a range of indicators. Second, we consider the depth of the decline in economic activity. The NBER definition includes the phrase, \u201ca significant decline in economic activity.\" Thus real GDP could decline by relatively small amounts in two consecutive quarters without warranting the determination that a peak had occurred. Third, our main focus is on the monthly chronology, which requires consideration of monthly indicators. Fourth, in examining the behavior of production on a quarterly basis, where real GDP data are available, we give equal weight to real GDI. The difference between GDP and GDI\u2014called the \u201cstatistical discrepancy\u201d\u2014was particularly important in the recessions of 2001 and 2007\u20132009."

Before this month's decline, they declined -152,000 in June.\n\n[Source for the above: BLS](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf)\n\nThe % of the population employed has actually been decreasing [since March](https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Percent-of-the-Entire-Population-That-Is-Employed-4.svg).\n\nYou can also read about it in this [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/05/july-jobs-report-shows-more-americans-working-part-time.html) article, which says of the increase in part-time workers, \"Involuntary part-time workers,\u201d those in part-time positions for economic reasons, increased by a seasonally adjusted 303,000 in July.\" \n\n---\n\nAdding to that, on Friday the Federal Reserve announced consumer borrowing rose 10.5% in June, after rising 6.3% in May. Revolving debt was up 16% m/m. In total, non-housing related debt grew in the second quarter by the most since 2016. [Source: CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/economy/june-consumer-credit-report-debt-increase/index.html). \n\nAmericans opened 233 million credit card accounts in the second quarter, the most since 2008 according to the NY Fed [Source: CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/economy/consumer-credit-borrowing-surge/index.html). \n\n\n\n---\n\nPoliticians and the top post on the sub seem excited but these numbers just don't look bullish to me unless you're looking for a part-time job in hospitality. \n\nIf the fed takes the headline numbers as license to raise rates even faster, we probably see more businesses laying full-time workers off.\n\n---\n\n**The top comment right now is asking about why the numbers don't add up to 528 so I'm adding that context here.** First, here's screenshots of CNBC [screenshot](https://imgur.com/oO7Elqd) and the [source article link](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/05/july-jobs-report-shows-more-americans-working-part-time.html) and the [BLS site](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FZaMiRFWIAEZE73?format=jpg&name=large) to back up the original numbers. \n\nThey were all sourced before but screenshots because redditors don't like clicking links.\n\nAnyway, the +528 is seasonally adjusted but it is from the Establishment Survey (pages 6-7 of the [Bureau of Labor Services monthly Employment Situation report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf)). Only the Household Survey data reports the breakdown between part-time and full-time is only reported in the Household Survey pages (pages 13-41). The Household Survey is how we determine the national unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate among other stats.\n\nThere is a different sample population (Household is bigger N, Establishment is smaller) and some differences between how people are counted in each survey. For example, if someone works multiple jobs they appear multiple times in Establishment but only once in Household. If someone is self-employed they appear in Household but not Establishment. Household counts self-employed but total Total Nonfarm Payroll was 152,536k for Establishment and employed Civilian labor force was 158,290k for Household.\n\nSo the numbers are a little off because the data sets are different even though both are published in the same report by the BLS.",

Few highlights:\n\n - Energy prices are obviously dominating the headline number.\n - Core CPI MoM dropped to 0.3%\n - Food prices still remained stubbornly high\n - Goods inflation largely cooled but in a mixed fashion, but vehicles, transportation and medical goods remained a bit elevated and many other goods actually dropping in price.  Perhaps the first confirmation of excess inventory and discounting that we had been hearing about from large retailers.\n - Shelter costs increased at the same rate, while an improvement from the accelerating rate of appreciation we've seen this is still contributing a significant amount to core inflation and something that needs to come down further.\n - Public transportation was largely responsible for keeping the MoM services number down, but also a significant contributor to the higher growth rate in services over recent months.  This is also essentially a pass through for energy costs and vehicle costs on the services side.\n\nPretty solid print overall.  Energy prices dropped and that has pretty significant impacts across the economy.  Hopefully that'll feed into lower food prices a bit going forward.  Housing costs still need to slow down and I know annecdotally it does seem like that's been happening around my area just based on where home prices have gone recently and with mortgage rates off the recent June highs.  Mortgage rates will probably creep back up north of 5% this week but not by much.\n\nWe've got another print to look forward to before the FOMC's next meeting ultimately here and I'm sure there's going to be plenty of commentary incoming from FOMC members to see if this has tilted rate hike expectations at all over the coming days/weeks."

                "text": "**TLDR**: the Porsche family is getting full control of Porsche the company literally for free. This is the main reason for the IPO. The way the IPO is structured will hurt VW and gullible investors buying into this. VW and its long-term strategy are thrown into disarray.\n\n**TLDR (with light details):**\n\n1. The Porsche family already owns a significant chunk of both VW and Porsche companies. But they want full control of the Porsche company.\n2. They ousted the CEO of VW on a pretext and forced the IPO that benefits only them.\n3. The family will get additional 25% of the Porsche, which will give them full control of the company.\n4. The family is not paying a market price for 25% stake. In fact, they are not paying at all, because they forced VW to pay a dividend from the IPO proceeds, which the family will get by being a shareholder of VW.\n5. Shares available to the public during the IPO are all non-voting.\n\n**Long story**\n\nThe way the IPO is organized is a disgrace, and if the German government allows it to go through as is, I will have no faith in making long-term investments in German stocks anymore.\n\nIf this is legal under German laws, then I'm not buying. If this is illegal and they don't do anything, I'm not buying either.\n\nTo understand what and why is happening you need a little context, so here it is.\n\nThe Porsche family lost control of the Porsche company during the 2008 financial crisis. They wanted to buy VW but ended up in a weird financial situation where they instead had to give up control of Porsche to VW but got a controlling voting stake in VW.\n\nThe ownership structure is complicated, but in a simplified form it looks like this:\n\n>The family -> Porsche Holdings -> VW company -> Porsche company\n\nThe IPO will make it look like this:\n\n>The family -> Porsche Holdings -> VW company (>50% of voting rights)  \n>  \n>The family -> Porsche Holdings -> Porsche Company (>50% of voting rights)\n\nThe money flow is like this:\n\n>The family \u201cbuys\u201d 25% of voting shares from VW below market price with no competition.  \n>  \n>VW pays 50% of IPO proceeds as dividends.  \n>  \n>The family gets its money back from VW in the form of dividends.\n\nThis IPO would be a disaster even during normal times. VW is losing its best cash cow, for half the price, and the price is below market rate. But it\u2019s happening during one of the worst times for IPOs ever. The stocks are in a global downturn, hammered by inflation, rising rates, quantitative tightening, supply chain issues, and ongoing war in Ukraine, which amplified all of the above and added energy crisis on top of that. Germany is in the worst economic situation since the fall of the Berlin wall.\n\nThis is not the right time to IPO a luxurious brand. However, this is the best time for the family to get their favorite asset out of VW. From their perspective, the less money IPO makes, the better. This conflict of interests is as bad as it gets.\n\nIPO shares available to the public will be useless non-voting shares for gullible investors, who do not understand what they are buying. Think SNAP or GOOG. But it gets worse.\n\nLet\u2019s remember for a moment, that VW was not a good company for a long while. It ended up in a \u201cdiesel gate\u201d scandal, had to pay enormous fines, as well as to change its CEO. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because VW got a good new CEO, had to reinvent itself by becoming more environmentally friendly, and thus started an early transition into EVs.\n\nVW is already a top seller of EVs in Europe and rapidly growing its market share. It has a vast portfolio of cars ranging all segments, from the cheapest economy cars to the most luxurious ones, of which Porsche is the main brand. Platforms within VW are interchangeable, they use the same tech across multiple brands to achieve synergy.\n\nNow, if you take Porsche out, these plans are thrown into disarray. On top of that, both Porsche and VW will have the same CEO, answering to the same family. Which company do you think he will prioritize more when it comes to that?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the transition to EVs was not going smooth already. There are issues with software, which VW was never good at historically. And the labor unions were very unhappy at the potential loss of jobs (because you need less jobs to make EVs). The family seized on this opportunity to oust the CEO under a pretext that the software was delayed, and the labor unions supported the change to get their job guarantees.\n\nThe labor unions now expect to keep their jobs, meaning VW will have to keep combustion engine factories operating for longer for no economical reason. This is good for workers, but a disaster for investors in VW. The family got their IPO, which is good for them, but also a disaster for investors. And the new CEO has no experience in building software whatsoever with no sound plans to address the problems.\n\nThe right change for VW would be to hire an experienced executive VP from one of the major tech companies in the US and improve their software development culture. There was no need to change their CEO, especially considering that VW was transitioning to EVs better than all of its competitors. But, oh well.\n\n**My positions:**\n\nI owned VW stock for a while and sold at \\~2x profit after the war in Ukraine started but was planning to buy back later. Now, however, if the IPO goes through, I\u2019m not touching this stock, or any other German stocks for that matter.",

They not only plan to make 10 billion \u20ac with this IPO, it's also probable that the two founding families Porsche and Pi\u00ebch will support the EV transition in return for control of Porsche.\n\nThe ousted CEO Herbert Diess ran into a lot of resistance with his ambitious plans to transform the company as there are many interests involved.\n\nThere are the influential and powerful founding families, the German state of Niedersachsen (lower saxony) which above all wants to retain jobs, the \"Betriebsrat\" (an organisation managing the rights and interests of VW's employees) and lastly the \"IG Metall\", one of Germany's last large and powerful unions.\n\nMost of these players are unhappy about the probable loss of jobs if VW transitions to electric vehicles and software. EV production can be highly automated and what VW really needs to do is to get rid of thousands of old economy employees and hire a bunch of software developers instead.\n\nThe union, the Betriebsrat and the state of lower saxony say that while the transition must happen, not a single job/employee must be left behind in the process which isn't realistic.\n\nThe interests of the two families are obscure, but their support - which basically will be bought with Porsche - removes at least one of the many walls of resistance.\n\nSo I guess the IPO is necessary, though I agree that the timing couldn't be worse. I also agree that retail investors should stay away from it and see how it pans out."

                "title": "I collect coins and banknotes as a hobby. Here is why buying money with the a picture of Queen Elizabeth II on it thinking these are going to become collectables is a bad investment idea",
                "text": "Over the next week or so there is going to be a wave of people passing through here with the 'unique' idea that they are going to buy some British banknotes or coins and that in just a short time its going to be a higly sought after collectable. It wont. This is a bad investment idea. Now naturally the kind of person who comes up with this get-rich-quick scheme is going to try anyway, but for the rest of us I will try and explain here why this is a bad idea.\n\nFirst, let me clarify the difference between currency value and collectable value. If I get a five quid note and I pay five quid to get it, this does not mean it is a collectable. That is just how money works. For something to be collectable it has to have a value above and beyond what you would be able to use it as if you just spent it as cash. To extend this just a tiny bit more, if I got an ultra rare limited edition five quid note that is in mint condition and I pay a million quid for it, the actual colectable value is nine hundred ninty nine thousand nine hundred ninty five quid.\n\nThe next thing I need to explain is marginal value. Lets say a store was selling apples. What would be the better sale price? Half off? Or buy one get one free? At first thought this seems total nonsense. Thats the same thing! But not so fast. What if I was selling toothbrushes? Do I realy need two toothbrushes? If I got a second toothbrush, one of those is just going to be kept under the sink untill the first toothbrush wears out. I would rather just get one toothbrush only and get it for half off. This is marginal utility.\n\nSo with both of these idea in mind, lets talk about coin collecting. Say someone wants to start collecting and the first thing they try is getting all five of the \"five good emperors\". They go to a few swap meats and quickly start acquiring the set. But  Nerva  is giving them some problems. No matter where they go, they cant seem to find a  Nerva. But they keep at it and soon enough they find one for sale but its $200. Ouch! Thats above their price point for just a starting collection, but they realy want to have the whole set. So they break down and pay it. A few more months roll by and they once again find someone selling a  Nerva  and selling it for $199. I this was absolutely any other product it would be natural to think they would buy this second one also. But what about the collectable value? What about the marginal utility? Do they honestly need a second copy of the  Emperor  Nerva  coin? The series is already complete so what's the point of having it in your collection twice? Who cares if its a buck cheaper. They wouldn't even buy it to try and \"flip\" to another collector. The time and effort they would need to go to in order to flip it would bot be worth making just $1 in profit.\n\nAnd that leads us finally to Queen Elizabeth II. Coins and banknotes with her likeness are not rare to begin with. Supply already way outstrips demand. But even on the demand side, collectables do not follow the regular supply-and-demand curve. Every economic textbook out there shows this graph as a smooth gently curving function. But the supply-and-demand for collectables doesn't do that. There is a hard upper limit that is the total number of people that are collectors. If the number of coins is less than the number of collectors, there will be demand. But if the number of coins is more than the number of people that are into the hobby, you do not get a slow gradual tapering off. You get a graph that drops off a cliff.\n\nThere are ancient roman coins out there that you can get even today that are just the value of the metal the coin is minted from. The collectable value that is above and buying the value of the base metal is basically zero. This is true despite the emperor depicted on the coin being dead for thousands of years. The reason they have no collectable value is ttoaly decoupled from the emperor being alive or dead. The lack of collectable value comes from the fact that the number of coins in existence is larger than the number of people in the hobby. There is enough to give all collectors at least one, and nobody cares about having a second one.\n\nCoins and Banknotes with Queen Elizabeth II will never have a collectable value. Dont even try to buy them up now with the hope that in the future you can sell them for more. It wont happen. It cant happen. Don't even try. If you want to use this event as motivation to get into coin collecting as a hobby them have at it! Its a great pastime and I will welcome you. But if your just out to flip coins as a get rich quick scheme, then dont.\n\n\"You know Jerry, I'm not gonna tell you that this coin will increase in value, or even hold its current value. The truth is, you brought it cuz you like it. It has value to you. That's what matters\"",

                "text": "(Financial Times) -- Organisation calls on central banks to co-ordinate policies and tighten less to avoid \u2018devastating\u2019 worldwide downturn\n\nThe World Bank has warned that leading central banks risk sending the global economy into a \u201cdevastating\u201d recession next year if policymakers raise interest rates too high over the months ahead and stress financial markets.\n\nThe Washington-based organisation called on monetary authorities in the big economies to co-ordinate their actions to reduce the overall amount of tightening.\n\nCentral banks, led by the US Federal Reserve, have embarked on a series of aggressive rate rises over the course of 2022 in a bid to tame inflation that is at, or close to, double figures in several advanced economies for the first time in decades.\n\nEnergy and food prices have surged following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in late February, triggering a cost of living crisis.\n\nTo avoid letting inflation rip, the World Bank urged governments to provide targeted relief to vulnerable households instead of relying on tighter monetary policy.\n\nDavid Malpass, president of the World Bank, said momentum in the global economy was sliding and more countries were already falling into recession. \u201cMy deep concern is that these trends will persist, with long-lasting consequences that are devastating for people in emerging market and developing economies,\u201d he added.\n\nHe called for more action to boost production to ease inflationary pressure, rather than all the focus being on curbing spending. Increased investment would, he said, \u201cimprove productivity and capital allocation, which are critical for growth and poverty reduction\u201d.\n\nThe World Bank did not produce new forecasts for the global economy, but noted that the outlook for 2023 had been sliding as rich and poor countries alike responded to high inflation this year by seeking to limit spending.\n\n\u201cCentral banks around the world have been raising interest rates this year with a degree of synchronicity not seen over the past five decades \u2014 a trend that is likely to continue well into next year,\u201d the World Bank said.\n\nThe warnings come ahead of crucial policy votes at the Fed and Bank of England next week. The US central bank is expected to raise rates by 75 basis points for the third meeting in a row on Thursday, while UK borrowing costs are likely to rise by 50 basis points.\n\nThe expected rises in global interest rates would bear down on inflation, but not enough to meet central banks\u2019 targets, which are usually around 2 per cent, the World Bank warned. Core global inflation, excluding energy, was still likely to be running at a rate of 5 per cent next year \u2014 twice the pre-pandemic rate.\n\nIf such a level of inflation persuaded central banks to become even more aggressive, global economic growth would drop to 0.5 per cent in 2023, according to the World Bank.\n\nThat would meet most definitions of a global recession just three years after the last one, the World Bank added, because with population growth, average global incomes would be falling.\n\nIn its modelling(opens a new window), the bank said there needed to be some tightening of monetary policy, but this should be accompanied by every effort to ease bottlenecks both internationally and domestically to allow production to increase without stoking inflation.\n\nThis includes boosting the supply of commodities, food and energy to alleviate much of the global inflationary forces, alongside investing to decarbonise economic growth.\n\nThe bank\u2019s findings have been echoed by former IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld, now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n\u201cJust as central banks, especially those of the richer countries, misread the factors driving inflation when it was rising in 2021, they may also be underestimating the speed with which inflation could fall as their economies slow,\u201d said Obstfeld, urging them to be less \u201czealous\u201d in raising interest rates.\n\n\u201cBy simultaneously all going in the same direction, they risk reinforcing each other\u2019s policy impacts without taking that feedback loop into account,\u201d he added.\n\nVia: [https://www.ft.com/content/d95de774-e4e4-4864-a5fd-a0f696ee6728](https://www.ft.com/content/d95de774-e4e4-4864-a5fd-a0f696ee6728) (non-paywall at: [https://archive.ph/jbzv0](https://archive.ph/jbzv0))",

Rate hikes have impact on companies many quarters after they take affect. Most talking heads in the media but also permabulls here on reddit seem to ignore that and just keep talking up the markets so beware. A short term rebound does not mean it can't go lower afterwards!\n\nWould not be surprised to see another short bear market pump before it goes much lower again once companies start revising their earnings forecast to the downside.\n\nPowell trying to talk up the markets afterwards clearly doesn't help anymore. He should stick to what FOMC members have decided instead of trying to give it a \"rosy\" spin.\n\nFinal point, so we now have a problem in the housing market, credit market (too much borrowing going on) and in the equity markets (earnings compression coming). Not sure how that combo will end but don't have a good feeling about this. Hope this won't be 2008 all over again or worse.\n\nThat's in a nutshell what the Fed decided today and its future impact on the markets. Stay careful and don't be a mindless sheep.",
